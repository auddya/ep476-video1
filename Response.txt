Response to the questions related to the video. 

1. One of the key skills/strategies which I usually practice, relevant to this talk
   is acknowledging someone's work. Often when we work as a team, it becomes increasingly crucial to assess each one's 
   performance. While some members might not be able to deliver the appropriate outcome which might be needed, 
   it is important their present work is understood and is given enough room for improvement, along with critical suggestions if necessary. This is 
   broadly described as "Making Opportunities for Praise" wherever possible

2. The one area which can be improvised, according to my perspective is "Promoting Psychological Safety". 
   At times when the situation isn't in my favour, I tend to prioritise my own efforts than giving an 
   oppportunity to invite suggestions or improvements.

3. When I was in high school, there was a Tech competition which my friends and I attended representing the school. 
   There were two goals to this event. Two science models needed to be sketched with a working demonstration. 
   One among these models had some issues completing its objective and I was quite sure how to fix the problem. 
   However our group leader wasn't accepting any suggestions as time was running out and the model wasn't in a state to be redesigned from a 
   certain point. Result: It didn't work. The flaw was inherent and it showed up during the demonstration. 
   This was one event where I felt the other person could have been atleast a less condescending. 

4. The Quotes used are: 
  1.  "I respect my limitations but I do not use them as an excuse"
  2.  "The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said"-Peter F Drucker 
  3.  "You don't need a plan, you just need to be present" Bob Goff
  4.  "Great things in business are never done by one person. They are done by a team of people" Paragon of the Silicon valley, Steve Jobs
 
   Out of these the quote which appealed to me the most is "The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said" 
   Non verbal communication constitute almost 97 percent of what a human being wants to express. We tend to judge their words only by the content. 
   It is essential to understand these conversations from a deeper perspective than simply a string of words.
